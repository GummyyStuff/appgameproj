# Case Opening Game Refactoring Requirements

## Introduction

The Case Opening Game Refactoring project aims to transform the current complex, hard-to-maintain case opening system into a clean, user-friendly, and performant feature. This document outlines the specific requirements for the refactoring effort, focusing on improving code maintainability, user experience, and system performance while preserving all existing functionality.
