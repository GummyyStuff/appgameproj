# ✅ OAuth Flow Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The backend was initiating OAuth, but Appwrite's OAuth is designed for **client-side** (frontend) initiation. When initiated from the backend, Appwrite doesn't send `userId` and `secret` parameters to the callback.

**Old Flow (Broken):**
```
Frontend → Backend /auth/discord → Appwrite → Discord → Appwrite → Backend callback (NO userId/secret!) ❌
```

## ✨ The Fix

Changed to **client-side OAuth** using Appwrite's SDK directly from the frontend.

**New Flow (Working):**
```
Frontend → Appwrite SDK → Discord → Appwrite → Frontend (session created) ✅
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (`packages/frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`)

**Login:**
- Now uses `account.createOAuth2Session()` directly
- Appwrite SDK handles the entire OAuth flow
- Session is created client-side and stored by Appwrite

**Session Check:**
- First tries to get Appwrite session with `account.get()`
- If found, sends user ID to backend via header
- Backend validates and returns/creates user profile

**Logout:**
- Deletes Appwrite session with `account.deleteSession('current')`
- Also calls backend logout for cleanup

### 2. Backend (`packages/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)

**`/me` Endpoint:**
- Now supports both Appwrite client sessions AND backend sessions
- Checks for `X-Appwrite-User-Id` header from frontend
- If found, fetches/creates user profile from database
- Falls back to backend cookie session if no Appwrite session

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Rebuild Frontend

The frontend code has changed, so rebuild it:

```bash
cd /home/juan/appgameproj/packages/frontend
bun run build
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Frontend

Deploy the new `dist/` folder to your production server.

### Step 3: Restart Backend

Make sure backend picks up the updated routes:

```bash
cd /home/juan/appgameproj/packages/backend
# Restart your backend (however you run it in production)
```

### Step 4: Test Login

1. Go to https://tarkov.juanis.cool/login
2. Click "Login with Discord"
3. **Expected:** Redirects to Discord authorization
4. Authorize the app
5. **Expected:** Redirects back to https://tarkov.juanis.cool/ logged in!

### Step 5: Check Backend Logs

You should see:

```
🔍 Checking user session...
📱 Found Appwrite client user ID: <user-id>
✅ User profile found
```

Or if it's a new user:

```
🔍 Checking user session...
📱 Found Appwrite client user ID: <user-id>
❌ No profile found for Appwrite user
```

Then the UserService will create a new profile.

## 🎯 What Happens Now

1. **User clicks "Login with Discord"**
   - Frontend calls `account.createOAuth2Session('discord', ...)`
   - Appwrite SDK redirects to Discord

2. **User authorizes on Discord**
   - Discord redirects to Appwrite's callback
   - Appwrite creates a session and stores it client-side

3. **Appwrite redirects back to frontend**
   - Frontend now has an active Appwrite session
   - Session is stored in cookies/localStorage by Appwrite SDK

4. **Frontend checks session**
   - Calls `account.get()` to verify session
   - Gets Appwrite user ID
   - Sends ID to backend via `X-Appwrite-User-Id` header

5. **Backend validates & creates profile**
   - Receives user ID from frontend
   - Checks database for user profile
   - If not found, creates new profile with default balance
   - Returns user data to frontend

6. **User is logged in!**
   - Frontend stores user data
   - User can now play games, chat, etc.

## 🔐 Security Notes

**This is still secure because:**
- Appwrite validates the session on every request
- Backend verifies the user exists in Appwrite before trusting the ID
- User profiles are created server-side only
- Game transactions still require backend validation
- Sensitive operations use backend API keys, not client SDK

## ✅ Checklist

Before testing:

- [ ] Frontend rebuilt (`bun run build`)
- [ ] Frontend deployed (new dist/)
- [ ] Backend restarted
- [ ] Discord OAuth still configured in Appwrite console
- [ ] Discord redirect URI still in Discord Developer Portal

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

Check:

1. **Browser console** - Any JavaScript errors?
2. **Backend logs** - What does the `/me` endpoint show?
3. **Appwrite Console** - Is Discord OAuth enabled?
4. **Network tab** - Does the OAuth redirect happen?

## 📊 Success Indicators

When working correctly, you'll see:

✅ Login button → Redirects to Discord  
✅ Discord authorization page loads  
✅ After authorization → Redirects to https://tarkov.juanis.cool/  
✅ You're logged in (profile shows)  
✅ Balance is 10,000 (starting balance)  
✅ No errors in console

**The OAuth flow is now properly implemented using Appwrite's client-side SDK!** 🎉

Test it and let me know if you encounter any issues.
