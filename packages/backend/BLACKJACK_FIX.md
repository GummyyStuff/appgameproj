# Blackjack Security Hardening Fix

## Issue
After implementing security hardening, blackjack actions were failing with 500 Internal Server Error due to validation issues.

## Root Cause
The `commonSchemas.gameId` validation was expecting UUID format (`z.string().uuid()`), but blackjack generates game IDs in the format: `blackjack-{timestamp}-{userId}` (e.g., `blackjack-1758476684395-c6e8eac9-9398-40f0-a366-07b521d8d433`).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Game ID Validation Schema
**File:** `packages/backend/src/middleware/validation.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
gameId: z.string().uuid(),
```

**After:**
```typescript
gameId: z.string().min(10).max(200).regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$/, 'Invalid game ID format'),
```

**Rationale:** 
- Accepts alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- Flexible length (10-200 characters) to accommodate different game ID formats
- Maintains security by preventing special characters that could be used for injection

### 2. Enhanced Audit Logging Error Handling
**File:** `packages/backend/src/middleware/audit.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added graceful handling for missing `audit_logs` table
- Improved error logging with specific error type detection
- Added fallback console logging when database operations fail
- Fixed request body consumption issue in audit middleware

### 3. Improved Context Type Definitions
**File:** `packages/backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`

**Added:**
```typescript
declare module 'hono' {
  interface ContextVariableMap {
    user: AuthUser
    validatedData: any
    sessionId: string
    sessionManager: any
    ipSecurityManager: any
  }
}
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
**File:** `packages/backend/src/routes/games.ts`

**Added debug logging to blackjack action endpoint to help troubleshoot validation issues.**

## Testing

### Validation Tests
Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

1. **`blackjack-validation.test.ts`** - Tests the updated gameId schema
2. **`blackjack-request.test.ts`** - Tests the exact request format from frontend

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Blackjack Game ID Validation > should accept blackjack game ID format
✓ Blackjack Game ID Validation > should accept other game ID formats  
✓ Blackjack Game ID Validation > should reject invalid game ID formats
✓ Blackjack Game ID Validation > should work with blackjack action schema
✓ Blackjack Request Validation > should validate the exact request from frontend
✓ Blackjack Request Validation > should handle optional handIndex
✓ Blackjack Request Validation > should validate all blackjack actions
✓ Blackjack Request Validation > should reject invalid actions
✓ Blackjack Request Validation > should reject invalid handIndex
```

All 9 tests pass, confirming the validation fix works correctly.

## Security Considerations

### Maintained Security
- Game ID validation still prevents injection attacks
- Only allows safe characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
- Length limits prevent buffer overflow attempts
- Threat detection remains active for all other inputs

### Backward Compatibility
- Fix maintains compatibility with existing game ID formats
- Roulette and Plinko games continue to work normally
- No changes required to frontend code

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
The `audit_logs` table should be created using the provided migration:
```sql
-- Run the SQL from packages/backend/src/database/migrations/005_audit_logs.sql
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. All security features work with existing configuration.

### Monitoring
- Audit logs will fall back to console logging if database table doesn't exist
- Security events continue to be logged via existing security logging system
- Rate limiting and other security measures remain fully functional

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the backend server**
2. **Test blackjack game flow:**
   - Start a blackjack game
   - Perform actions (hit, stand, double, split)
   - Verify no 500 errors occur
3. **Check security features:**
   - Verify rate limiting works
   - Check that malicious inputs are rejected
   - Confirm audit logging works (console fallback if table missing)

## Future Improvements

1. **Standardize Game ID Format:** Consider using UUIDs for all games for consistency
2. **Database Migration:** Apply the audit_logs table migration in production
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up alerts for audit logging failures
4. **Performance Optimization:** Consider caching for frequently accessed validation schemas

## Summary

The blackjack functionality has been restored while maintaining all security hardening measures. The fix addresses the immediate validation issue while preserving the comprehensive security features implemented in the security hardening task.
