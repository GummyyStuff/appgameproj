/**
 * Database Service Tests - DEPRECATED FOR APPWRITE
 * 
 * NOTE: This test file is now deprecated as we've migrated from Supabase to Appwrite.
 * The DatabaseService has been replaced with individual Appwrite services:
 * - UserService (user-service.ts)
 * - GameService (game-service.ts)
 * - CurrencyService (currency-new.ts)
 * - ChatService (chat-service.ts)
 * - AuditService (audit-service.ts)
 * 
 * See those individual service test files for testing these features.
