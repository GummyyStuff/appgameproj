# üöÄ Font Awesome Self-Host Quick Start

## TL;DR - Get Font Awesome Working in Coolify (Without Committing to Git)

### ‚ö° Fastest Method (Recommended)

1. **Package Font Awesome:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/juan/appgameproj
   ./scripts/package-fontawesome.sh
   ```
   Creates: `fontawesome-pro-v5-trimmed.tar.gz` (~18MB)

2. **Upload to your server:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Your own server
   scp fontawesome-pro-v5-trimmed.tar.gz user@yourserver.com:/var/www/private/
   
   # Option 2: DigitalOcean Spaces / S3
   s3cmd put fontawesome-pro-v5-trimmed.tar.gz s3://your-bucket/
   ```

3. **Add to Coolify environment variables:**
   ```
   Name:  FONTAWESOME_URL
   Value: https://yourserver.com/path/to/fontawesome-pro-v5-trimmed.tar.gz
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure it's available as a **Build Argument**!

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add Dockerfile coolify.json .gitignore scripts/
   git commit -m "feat: add Font Awesome download during build"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Done!** Coolify will download Font Awesome during build automatically.

## üìã What Was Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Dockerfile` | Added Font Awesome download step during frontend build |
| `coolify.json` | Added `FONTAWESOME_URL` build argument |
| `.gitignore` | Added Font Awesome exclusion (prevents accidental commits) |
| `scripts/package-fontawesome.sh` | New script to package Font Awesome for upload |
| `scripts/setup-fontawesome-coolify.sh` | Interactive setup helper |

    D --> E[Builds Frontend with Font Awesome]
    E --> F[Deploys Container]
    F --> G[Font Awesome Available! üéâ]
```

1. You push code to Git (without Font Awesome files)
2. Coolify starts Docker build
3. During build, `FONTAWESOME_URL` is used to download Font Awesome
4. Font Awesome is extracted to `public/fa-v5-pro/`
5. Frontend builds with Font Awesome available
6. Production container has Font Awesome ready to serve
