# No Automatic Markdown File Creation

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do NOT create markdown (.md) files unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Rules

### ❌ Never Do This (Without Explicit Request)
- Creating summary/status files (e.g., `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `STATUS.md`)
- Creating guide files (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
- Creating documentation files (e.g., `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`, `API_DOCS.md`)
- Creating any `.md` file in the project root
- Creating changelog or migration files automatically

### ✅ Always Do This Instead
- **Provide information in chat responses** - Give summaries, explanations, and documentation directly in your response
- **Use code comments** - For technical documentation, use inline code comments
- **Wait for explicit request** - Only create markdown files when user says "create a markdown file" or "document this in a file"

### ✅ Exceptions (Allowed)
- `README.md` in appropriate directories (when creating new packages/modules and user approves)
- Markdown files explicitly requested by the user
- Modifying existing markdown files when asked

## Examples

### ❌ Bad - Don't Do This
```
User: "Implement the new auth system"
AI: *implements code*
AI: *creates AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md with details*  ← WRONG!
```

### ✅ Good - Do This
```
User: "Implement the new auth system"
AI: *implements code*
AI: *explains implementation in chat response*  ← CORRECT!
```

### ✅ When It's OK
```
User: "Implement auth and create a markdown file documenting it"
AI: *implements code*
AI: *creates AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md*  ← CORRECT! (explicit request)
```

## Why This Rule Exists

1. **Keep project clean** - Avoid cluttering the repository with documentation files
2. **Reduce noise** - Too many .md files make it hard to find important ones
3. **Chat is better** - For most use cases, explaining in chat is more efficient
4. **Version control** - Fewer files means cleaner git history

## When User Asks for Documentation

If user needs documentation:
1. Ask: "Would you like me to create a markdown file for this, or explain it in chat?"
2. Default to explaining in chat unless they specifically request a file
3. If creating a file, ask for preferred location and filename

## Summary

**Default behavior**: Communicate all information in chat responses.
**Only create .md files**: When explicitly requested by the user.
