## ⚠️ Required Manual Step

### Update game_history Collection in Appwrite

**Issue**: Appwrite Collections API doesn't support modifying enum attribute values after creation.

**Solution**: Manually update the collection in Appwrite Console.

#### Steps:

1. Go to Appwrite Console → Databases → tarkov_casino → game_history
2. Go to **Attributes** tab
3. Find the `game_type` attribute (enum type)
4. **Delete** the `game_type` attribute
5. **Recreate** it with these values:
   - `roulette`
   - `blackjack`
   - `case_opening`
   - `stock_market` ⬅️ **ADD THIS ONE**
6. Make it **required**
7. Save

**Alternative**: If you have no important data, delete and recreate the collection:
```bash
bun run packages/backend/scripts/setup-game-history-collection.ts
```

**Documentation**: See `packages/backend/scripts/update-game-history-collection.md`

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Appwrite Collections Limitation**: Enum attributes cannot be modified after creation. Always plan for future game types.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Appwrite Realtime is excellent for live updates. Use it for all real-time features.

3. **Provably Fair**: Hybrid approach (provably fair + realistic) provides the best of both worlds.

4. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase maintainable.

5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches many bugs at compile time.

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the documentation in `packages/backend/scripts/update-game-history-collection.md`
2. Review the API documentation in `README.md`
3. Check Appwrite Console for collection status
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
