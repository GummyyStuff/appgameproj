## Progress Tracking
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
- **Current Phase**: Authentication Migration Complete - Testing Phase
- **Build Status**: âœ… Frontend & Backend builds passing
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Configure Discord OAuth in Appwrite console
  2. Set environment variables
  3. Test authentication flows
  4. Begin database schema design for Step 3

## Notes
- Keep Supabase instance running during migration for fallback
- Maintain data consistency between systems during transition
- Monitor application performance after migration
- Schedule migration during low-traffic periods
