# Blackjack Game Rules

## Overview

Blackjack is a strategic card game where the goal is to get cards totaling closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Our Tarkov-themed version follows standard blackjack rules with immersive Escape from Tarkov styling.

## Game Objective

**Primary Goal**: Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding 21.

**Ways to Win**:
1. Get 21 with your first two cards (Blackjack)
2. Have a higher total than the dealer without busting
3. Dealer busts (goes over 21) while you don't

## Card Values

### Number Cards (2-10)
- **Value**: Face value
- **Example**: 7 of Hearts = 7 points

### Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King)
- **Value**: 10 points each
- **Example**: King of Spades = 10 points

### Aces
- **Value**: 1 or 11 (whichever is more favorable)
- **Soft Hand**: Hand with Ace counted as 11
- **Hard Hand**: Hand with Ace counted as 1
- **Example**: Ace + 6 = 17 (soft) or 7 (hard)

## How to Play

### Step 1: Place Your Bet
- Choose bet amount before cards are dealt
- Minimum bet: 10 virtual currency
- Maximum bet: 10,000 virtual currency
- Must have sufficient balance

> **Note**: All bets use virtual currency with no real-world value.

### Step 2: Initial Deal
- You receive 2 cards face up
- Dealer receives 2 cards (1 face up, 1 face down)
- If you get 21 (Blackjack), you win immediately (unless dealer also has 21)

### Step 3: Player Actions
Choose from available actions based on your hand:

#### Hit
- **Action**: Take another card
- **When**: Hand total is low and you want to improve
- **Risk**: Might bust if total exceeds 21

#### Stand
- **Action**: Keep current hand total
- **When**: Satisfied with current total
- **Result**: Turn passes to dealer

#### Double Down
- **Action**: Double your bet and take exactly one more card
- **When**: Confident next card will improve hand
- **Restriction**: Only available on first two cards
- **Note**: Cannot hit again after doubling

#### Split
- **Action**: Split identical cards into two separate hands
- **When**: Dealt two cards of same rank (e.g., two 8s)
- **Cost**: Additional bet equal to original bet
- **Play**: Each hand played separately
- **Restriction**: Some casinos limit re-splitting

### Step 4: Dealer Play
After you complete your hand(s):
1. Dealer reveals hidden card
2. Dealer must hit on 16 or less
3. Dealer must stand on 17 or more
4. Dealer busts if total exceeds 21

### Step 5: Determine Winner
- **Player Blackjack**: Pays 3:2 (unless dealer also has blackjack)
- **Player Wins**: Pays 1:1 (even money)
- **Push (Tie)**: Bet is returned
- **Player Loses**: Bet is lost

## Special Situations

### Blackjack (Natural 21)
- **Definition**: Ace + 10-value card with first two cards
- **Payout**: 3:2 (bet 100, win 150 + original bet)
- **Beats**: Any other 21 made with more than 2 cards
- **Push**: Only if dealer also has blackjack

### Bust
- **Definition**: Hand total exceeds 21
- **Result**: Immediate loss of bet
- **Dealer Bust**: All remaining players win

### Push (Tie)
- **Definition**: Player and dealer have same total
- **Result**: Bet is returned (no win or loss)
- **Exception**: Player blackjack vs dealer 21 (player wins)

### Soft vs Hard Hands
- **Soft Hand**: Contains Ace counted as 11
- **Hard Hand**: No Ace or Ace counted as 1
- **Example**: A-6 is soft 17, can become hard 17 if you hit with 10

## Basic Strategy

- Hard 12: Stand against dealer 4-6, otherwise hit
- Hard 13-16: Stand against dealer 2-6, otherwise hit

### When to Stand
- Hard 17 or higher: Always stand

### When to Split

- **Conditional Splits**:
  - 2s and 3s: Against dealer 2-7
