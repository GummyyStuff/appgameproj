# Testing After Fixes

## ✅ What We Just Fixed

1. **Downgraded Appwrite SDK** to match server version 1.7.4
   - Backend: `node-appwrite@11.0.0`
   - Frontend: `appwrite@14.0.1`
   - **Result:** No more SDK version warnings! 🎉

2. **Auto-Create User Profiles** on first login
   - When you log in with Discord, backend now automatically creates your profile
   - Default balance: 10,000
   - **Result:** No more 401 errors after login! 🎉

## 🔄 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Restart Backend

Since we changed the code and downgraded SDKs:

```bash
# Stop your backend (Ctrl+C)
cd /home/juan/appgameproj/packages/backend
bun run dev
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Frontend

Since we downgraded the frontend SDK:

```bash
cd /home/juan/appgameproj/packages/frontend
bun run build
# Then redeploy the dist/ folder
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

**Important!** Clear your browser cache/cookies or use incognito mode to test fresh.

### Step 4: Test Login Flow

1. Go to https://tarkov.juanis.cool/login
2. Click "Login with Discord"
3. Authorize (if needed)
4. **Expected:** You should be logged in and redirected to home page

## 🧪 What to Check After Login

### ✅ Backend Logs Should Show:

```
🔍 Checking user session...
📱 Found Appwrite client user ID: <your-id>
📝 No profile found, creating new user profile...
✅ User profile created successfully
```

**First time only - subsequent logins will show:**
```
🔍 Checking user session...
📱 Found Appwrite client user ID: <your-id>
✅ User profile found
```

### ✅ Frontend Should Show:

- Your username/display name
- Balance: **10,000** (starting balance)
- No errors in browser console
- No 401 errors in Network tab

---

### 1. **Profile Display**
- Check if your profile information loads
- Should show username and balance

### 2. **Balance Display**

- Real-time updates should work

### 3. **Case Opening** (Most Important!)

2. Click "Open"
3. **Expected:**
   - Balance decreases by 500 → **9,500**
   - You receive an item
   - Item value is added to balance
   - Game history is recorded

### 4. **Chat**

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

**Share with me:**

1. **Backend logs** - Copy the console output
2. **Browser console errors** - Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. **Network errors** - DevTools → Network tab → Failed requests (red)
4. **What feature failed** - Be specific (e.g., "case opening", "chat", etc.)

---

## 📊 Expected Results

When everything works:

✅ Login with Discord → Profile created automatically  
✅ Balance shows 10,000  
✅ Case opening works (balance updates)  
✅ Chat messages send and receive  
✅ No 401 errors  
✅ No SDK warnings  
✅ Profile persists across page refreshes  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm everything works:

1. ✅ Test all game features
2. ✅ Test chat functionality
3. ✅ Cleanup old Supabase code
4. ✅ Update documentation
5. ✅ Deploy to production

**Restart your backend, rebuild frontend, and test!** Let me know what works and what doesn't. 🎉
