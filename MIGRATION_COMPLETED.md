## What Was Migrated

### Database Collections (9 total)

All collections created with proper attributes, indexes, and permissions:

1. **users** - User profiles and stats
2. **game_history** - Game play records
3. **daily_bonuses** - Daily bonus claims
4. **case_types** - Case configurations (4 cases)
5. **tarkov_items** - Items that can be won (20 items)
6. **case_item_pools** - Case-to-item mappings (35 pool entries)
7. **chat_messages** - Chat messages
8. **chat_presence** - Online users
9. **audit_logs** - Audit trail

### Backend Services (New Files Created)

All services rewritten to use Appwrite instead of SQL:

- ✅ `services/appwrite-database.ts` - Centralized database service
- ✅ `services/user-service.ts` - User operations
- ✅ `services/game-service.ts` - Game history
- ✅ `services/currency-new.ts` - Currency with application-level transactions
- ✅ `services/chat-service.ts` - Chat operations
- ✅ `services/audit-service.ts` - Audit logging
- ✅ `services/case-opening-appwrite.ts` - Case opening logic
- ✅ `services/statistics-appwrite.ts` - Statistics and analytics (NEW)
- ✅ `middleware/auth.ts` - Updated authentication middleware
- ✅ `routes/chat.ts` - Chat routes (already existed)

### Frontend Services

- ✅ `services/appwrite-realtime.ts` - Realtime subscriptions
- ✅ `hooks/useChatRealtime.ts` - Already migrated
- ✅ `hooks/useGameRealtime.ts` - Already migrated
- ✅ `hooks/usePresence.ts` - Already migrated

### Scripts

- ✅ `scripts/seed-appwrite.ts` - Database seeding

---

## Files Removed

### Backend
- ❌ `config/supabase.ts` - Supabase configuration
- ❌ `services/database.ts` - Old Supabase database service
- ❌ `services/statistics.ts` - Old Supabase statistics service
- ❌ `services/case-opening.ts` - Old Supabase case opening service
- ❌ `services/realtime-supabase.ts` - Supabase realtime service
- ❌ All SQL migration files (50+ files in `database/migrations/`)

### Frontend
- ❌ `lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client
- ❌ `hooks/useSupabaseRealtime.ts` - Supabase realtime hook
- ❌ `hooks/useChatRealtime-old.ts` - Old chat hook

### Dependencies
- ❌ `@supabase/supabase-js` removed from both packages

---

## Database Schema (NoSQL)

### Key Design Decisions

**1. JSON Storage:**
- Complex objects stored as JSON strings (e.g., `resultData`, `rarityDistribution`)
- Parsed in application layer, not in database queries

**2. Composite Keys:**
- Workaround for lack of multi-column unique constraints
- Example: `userBonusKey` = `${userId}_${date}` for daily bonuses
- Example: `caseItemKey` = `${caseTypeId}_${itemId}` for case pools

**3. Attribute Types:**
- Used `string` instead of `url` type for URL fields (compatibility)
- Used `string` instead of `ip` type for IP addresses
- All JSON data stored as `string` attributes

**4. Permissions Model:**
- Document-level permissions for user data
- Server-side API key access for sensitive operations
- Public read for game configuration data

---

## Application-Level Transactions

Since Appwrite doesn't have native multi-document transactions, we implemented application-level transaction logic:

### Currency Service Transaction Pattern

```typescript
async processCaseOpening(userId, cost, winnings, metadata) {
  try {
    // 1. Get current balance
    const currentBalance = await getUserBalance(userId);
    
    // 2. Validate sufficient funds
    if (currentBalance < cost) {
      throw new Error('Insufficient balance');
    }
    
    // 3. Calculate new balance
    const newBalance = currentBalance - cost + winnings;
    
    // 4. Update user balance
    await updateUserProfile(userId, { 
      balance: newBalance,
      totalWagered: increment(cost),
      totalWon: increment(winnings),
      gamesPlayed: increment(1)
    });
    
    // 5. Record game history
    await createGameHistory(userId, {
      gameType: 'case_opening',
      betAmount: cost,
      winAmount: winnings,
      resultData: JSON.stringify(metadata)
    });
    
    return { success: true, newBalance };
  } catch (error) {
    // Application-level rollback would go here if needed
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}
```

## Realtime Implementation

### Appwrite Realtime Channels

**Chat Messages:**
```javascript
channel: `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.collections.chat_messages.documents`
```

**Chat Presence:**
```javascript
channel: `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.collections.chat_presence.documents`
```

**User Balance:**
```javascript
channel: `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.collections.users.documents.${userId}`
```

**Game History:**
```javascript
channel: `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.collections.game_history.documents`
```

---

## API Routes Updated

All routes now use Appwrite services:

- ✅ `/api/auth/*` - Authentication (Discord OAuth)
- ✅ `/api/user/*` - User profile, balance, stats, daily bonus
- ✅ `/api/games/*` - Roulette, Blackjack, Case Opening
- ✅ `/api/chat/*` - Chat messages, presence, online users
- ✅ `/api/statistics/*` - Advanced statistics and analytics

---

## Seeded Data

### Case Types (4)
1. **Starter Case** - 500 coins
2. **Military Case** - 1,000 coins
3. **Premium Case** - 2,500 coins
4. **Legendary Case** - 5,000 coins

### Tarkov Items (20)
- Common: Bandage, Water Bottle, Energy Drink, Cigarettes
- Uncommon: AI-2 Medikit, Tushonka, CPU Fan, Bolts
- Rare: IFAK, GPU, Bitcoin, Roler Watch
- Epic: Grizzly Med Kit, LEDX, Military Cable, Tetriz
- Legendary: Red/Violet/Blue/Green Keycards

### Case-Item Pools (35 entries)
Each case has weighted item distributions configured for balanced gameplay.

## Known Limitations

1. **No Native Transactions:** Application-level transaction handling required
2. **No Complex Queries:** Can't do JOINs or complex aggregations in database
3. **Limited Counting:** Appwrite doesn't easily expose total document counts
4. **No Composite Indexes:** Workaround using compound string attributes

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `bun install` in both packages to remove Supabase
2. ✅ Verify Appwrite endpoint is accessible
3. ⏳ Test authentication flow
4. ⏳ Test game playing (Roulette, Blackjack, Case Opening)
5. ⏳ Test chat functionality
6. ⏳ Test realtime subscriptions
7. ⏳ Monitor performance and optimize queries
8. ⏳ Set up proper error monitoring
9. ⏳ Document any issues or edge cases

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created
All critical fields indexed for performance:
- User lookups: `username`, `userId`
- Game queries: `userId`, `gameType`, `createdAt`
- Chat: `userId`, `createdAt`
- Case pools: `caseTypeId`, `itemId`, `caseItemKey`

### Caching Recommendations
Consider implementing caching for:
- Case types and items (rarely change)
- User profiles (update frequently but read more)
- Online user counts
- Global statistics
