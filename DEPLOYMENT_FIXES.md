# Console Errors - Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed all console errors related to Supabase migration, authentication, and Appwrite connectivity issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Supabase Reference Error
**Error:** `ReferenceError: supabase is not defined` in `caseOpeningApi.ts`

**Fix:** Removed all `supabase.auth.getSession()` calls and `Authorization` headers. Now uses `credentials: 'include'` for cookie-based authentication.

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/frontend/src/services/caseOpeningApi.ts`

### 2. ✅ Missing Query Methods
**Error:** `appwriteDb.greaterThanEqual is not a function`

**Fix:** Added missing query helper methods to `AppwriteDatabaseService`:
- `greaterThanEqual()`
- `lessThanEqual()`

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/services/appwrite-database.ts`

### 3. ✅ Socket Connection Errors
**Error:** `The socket connection was closed unexpectedly` (intermittent Appwrite API failures)

**Fix:** Implemented automatic retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts) for all Appwrite operations:
- OAuth session creation
- Session validation  
- Database queries
- User profile fetching

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/utils/appwrite-retry.ts` (NEW)
- `packages/backend/src/config/appwrite.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/services/appwrite-database.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

### 4. ✅ Cookie Configuration
**Error:** Session cookies not being sent/received

**Fix:** 
- Removed explicit `domain` parameter (now uses host-only cookies)
- Fixed `secure` flag detection for production
- Added comprehensive cookie logging

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

### 5. ✅ Missing Service Imports
**Error:** `DatabaseService` not found in statistics routes

**Fix:** Updated imports to use new Appwrite services:
- `UserService.getUserStatistics()`
- `GameService.getGameHistory()`

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/statistics.ts`

### 6. ✅ Global Statistics Error Handling
**Error:** 500 error on `/api/statistics/global` with empty database

**Fix:** 
- Handle empty data gracefully (`data || []`)
- Return empty statistics instead of crashing
- Fixed user count query to use `total` instead of `data.length`

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/services/statistics-appwrite.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/index.ts`

### 7. ✅ Enhanced Monitoring
**Added:** Better health checks and connection diagnostics

**New Files:**
- `packages/backend/src/scripts/test-appwrite.ts` - Appwrite connectivity test
- `packages/backend/src/scripts/diagnose-connection.ts` - Network diagnostics

**Files Changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/monitoring.ts` - Added Appwrite connectivity check to `/api/ready`

## Deployment Checklist

### Backend
```bash
cd /home/juan/appgameproj/packages/backend
bun run build
# Push to git for Coolify to rebuild
```

**Verify after deployment:**
1. Check `/api/ready` - Should show `"status": "connected"`
2. Check backend logs for `✅ Succeeded on attempt X/5` messages
3. No more socket connection errors

### Frontend
Frontend code is already correct (uses Appwrite client SDK). If you rebuilt it recently in Coolify, it should be fine.

## Testing After Deployment

### 1. Clear Browser Cookies
1. Open DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Delete all cookies for `tarkov.juanis.cool`
3. Refresh page

### 2. Login via Discord
1. Click "Login with Discord"
2. Should redirect to Discord OAuth
3. After authorizing, should redirect back to your site
4. Check DevTools → Application → Cookies for Appwrite session

### 3. Expected Console Output
**Backend logs should show:**
```
📱 Found Appwrite client user ID: ...
✅ Succeeded on attempt 2/5
✅ User profile found
```

**Frontend console should have:**
- ❌ NO "supabase is not defined" errors
- ❌ NO "The socket connection was closed" errors
- ✅ Only harmless Cloudflare beacon DNS error

## Remaining Non-Issues

### Cloudflare Insights Error (Harmless)
```
GET https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```
This is injected by Cloudflare and doesn't affect functionality. Can be safely ignored.

### 401 Errors When Not Logged In (Expected)
These are normal security behavior:
- `/api/user/balance`
- `/api/user/profile`
- `/api/chat/messages`

## Architecture Notes

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Frontend uses Appwrite **client SDK** for OAuth (browser-based session)
2. Frontend sends `X-Appwrite-User-Id` header to backend
3. Backend validates user and fetches/creates profile
4. Backend uses retry logic to handle intermittent socket errors

**Why Socket Errors Occur:**
The Coolify Docker container experiences intermittent connection drops to `db.juanis.cool`. This is likely due to:
- Docker network configuration
- Cloudflare proxy timeouts
- Container DNS resolution delays

**Solution:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts) successfully handles these transient failures.

## Success Criteria

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ No "supabase is not defined" errors
- ✅ No 500 errors on statistics endpoint
- ✅ Profile loads correctly when logged in
- ✅ Retry logic handles socket errors gracefully
- ✅ All database queries succeed (maybe after 2-3 retries)

## Notes

All code changes have been tested locally and work correctly. The socket errors are environmental (Coolify Docker networking) and are now handled gracefully with automatic retries.
