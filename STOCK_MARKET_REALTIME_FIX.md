# Stock Market Real-time Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Real-time Updates Not Working
**Problem:** The stock market wasn't updating in real-time despite having a realtime hook.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect channel format in the Appwrite Realtime subscription.

**Solution:** Updated the channel format from:
- ❌ `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.collections.stock_market_state.documents.current`
- ✅ `databases.${DATABASE_ID}.tables.stock_market_state.rows.current`

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed channel format in `useStockMarketRealtime.ts` to use `tables` instead of `collections`
- Updated event filtering to properly detect update/create events
- Added console logging for debugging real-time updates

### 2. Page Refresh on Buy/Sell
**Problem:** Buying or selling stocks caused the entire page to refresh.

**Root Cause:** The `onTradeSuccess` callback was calling `loadInitialData()` which reloaded all market data.

**Solution:** Removed the unnecessary callback and let the component handle its own state updates.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `onTradeSuccess` prop from `StockMarketTrading` component
- Removed `loadInitialData` callback from `StockMarketPage`
- Position and balance updates now happen locally without full page reload

## Technical Details

### Appwrite Realtime Channels

The correct channel format for Appwrite Realtime subscriptions is:

```
databases.<DATABASE_ID>.tables.<TABLE_ID>.rows.<ROW_ID>
```

For subscribing to all rows in a table:
```
databases.<DATABASE_ID>.tables.<TABLE_ID>.rows
```

### Event Types

The following events are available for real-time updates:

- `databases.*.tables.*.rows.*.create` - New row created
- `databases.*.tables.*.rows.*.update` - Row updated
- `databases.*.tables.*.rows.*.delete` - Row deleted
